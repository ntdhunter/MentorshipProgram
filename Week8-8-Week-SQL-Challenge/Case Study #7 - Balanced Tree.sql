-- Reporting Challenge
-- Write a single SQL script that combines all of the previous questions into a scheduled report that the Balanced Tree team can run at the beginning of each month to calculate the previous monthâ€™s values.
 -- Imagine that the Chief Financial Officer (who is also Danny) has asked for all of these questions at the end of every month.
 -- He first wants you to generate the data for January only - but then he also wants you to demonstrate that you can easily run the same analysis for February without many changes (if at all).
 -- Feel free to split up your final outputs into as many tables as you need - but be sure to explicitly reference which table outputs relate to which question for full marks :)
 -- Bonus Challenge
-- Use a single SQL query to transform the product_hierarchy and product_prices datasets to the product_details table.
 -- Hint: you may want to consider using a recursive CTE to solve this problem!
