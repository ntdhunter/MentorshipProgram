FROM plan_per_customer
WHERE plan_name = 'churn'
  AND counts = 2;

-- Using the LEAD() window function to find next plan of currnent plan
-- The LEAD window function in PostgreSQL is used to access data from a subsequent row in the same result set without the need for a self-join.
-- It is particularly useful for performing calculations or comparisons between rows in a data set.
WITH ranked_cte AS
  (SELECT sub.customer_id,
          plans.plan_name,
          LEAD(plans.plan_name) OVER (PARTITION BY sub.customer_id

-- 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
-- Answer:
WITH next_plans AS
  (SELECT customer_id,
          plan_id,
          LEAD(plan_id) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id
                             ORDER BY plan_id) AS next_plan_id

-- 7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
-- Answer:
-- Statistical the customer count and percentage from the start to 31-12-2020 for all 5 plans
WITH next_dates AS

-- 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
-- Answer:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.customer_id)
FROM foodie_fi.plans p
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions s ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
WHERE DATE_PART('year', s.start_date) = 2020

-- 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
-- Answer:
-- trial_plan CTE: Filter results to include only the customers subscribed to the trial plan.
-- annual_plan CTE: Filter results to only include the customers subscribed to the pro annual plan.
-- bins CTE: Put customers in 30-day buckets based on the average number of days taken to upgrade to a pro annual plan.
-- The width_bucket function in PostgreSQL is used to categorize a continuous range of values into a specified number of equal-width buckets. 
-- It is commonly used for histograms and frequency distribution analysis.
WITH trial_plan AS
  (SELECT customer_id,
          start_date AS trial_date

-- 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
-- Answer:
