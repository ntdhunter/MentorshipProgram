-- A. Data Cleansing Steps
-- In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

-- Convert the week_date to a DATE format
-- Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
-- Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
-- Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
-- Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
-- Answer:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;
CREATE TEMP TABLE clean_weekly_sales AS (
SELECT
  TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY') AS week_date,
  DATE_PART('week', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS week_number,
  DATE_PART('month', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS month_number,
  DATE_PART('year', TO_DATE(week_date, 'DD/MM/YY')) AS calendar_year,
  region, 
  platform, 
  segment,
  CASE 
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '1' THEN 'Young Adults'
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) = '2' THEN 'Middle Aged'
    WHEN RIGHT(segment,1) in ('3','4') THEN 'Retirees'
    ELSE 'unknown' END AS age_band,
  CASE 
    WHEN LEFT(segment,1) = 'C' THEN 'Couples'
    WHEN LEFT(segment,1) = 'F' THEN 'Families'
    ELSE 'unknown' END AS demographic,
  transactions,
  ROUND((sales::NUMERIC/transactions),2) AS avg_transaction,
  sales
