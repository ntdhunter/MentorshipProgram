-- A. Data Cleansing Steps
-- In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:
 -- Convert the week_date to a DATE format
-- Add a week_number as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
-- Add a month_number with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
-- Add a calendar_year column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
-- Add a new column called age_band after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value
-- Answer:

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS clean_weekly_sales;

-- C. Before & After Analysis
-- 1. What are the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales?

SELECT DISTINCT week_number
FROM clean_weekly_sales
